# Multiple Domain Prices Estimator

This project is a through application for predicting prices of certain domains with machine learning. We used regression algorithms that are available in scikit-learn. My task was majorly based on supervised learning so I used following algorithms:

1.Stoichastic Gradient Descent Regressor

2.Adaboost Regressor

3.Decision Tree Regressor

4.Gradient Boosting Regressor



We used complex algorithms because the datasets that we had we very complex.
